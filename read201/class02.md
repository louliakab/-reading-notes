these boxes.

The border-width property is used to control the width of a border. The value of this 
property can either be given in pixels or using one of the following values
(thin,medium,thick)
* Set margins and padding for boxes:
#### The margin property 
controls the gap between boxes. Its value is commonly given in pixels, although you may also use percentages or ems.

the visibility property allows you to hide boxes from users but It leaves a space where the element would have been.This property can take two values:
1.hidden:This hides the element.
2.visible:This shows the element.If the visibility of an element is set to hidden, a blank space will appear in its place.
