# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
l1.earn
Even though the ultimate goal is to produce a fully working piece of code, pair programming can be employed for various reasons.
2.Onboard a junior developer
The most common usage is a junior programmer pairing with a senior one. The former types while the latter instructs on what to do or help the junior figure it out without giving the solution beforehand.
3.Build up self-confidence
Two juniors pairing together is generally considered a bad combination.
4.Share the knowledge
The last scenario Iâ€™ve not tackled yet is two senior devs pairing together
5.Reduce code defects
There are numerous flaws we can potentially write when coding solo.
6.Improve code quality
Pair programming allows to share consistent coding practices between team members.
