*Structure of an HTML Document*
An HTML Document is mainly divided into two parts:

HEAD: This contains the information about the HTML document. For Example, Title of the page, version of HTML, Meta Data etc.
BODY: This contains everything you want to display on the Web Page.
Let us now have a look on the basic structure of HTML. That is the code which is must for every webpage to have:

  
<!-- <html>
    <head>
        <title>
              
        </title>
    </head>
      
    <body>
          
    </body>
</html> -->

Every Webpage must contain this code.
